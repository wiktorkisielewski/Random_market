# Random_market
An automated [and hypotheticaly profitable] trading bot operating on GOLD/USD futures contracts.

# How it works?
This bot trades on XAUUSD futures contracts,<br> takes one trade at the time in a random direction. <br> <br>
It uses a trailing stop loss, which mean it will close a position only after the price of futures contract goes n % in a wrong/unwanted direction.
This limits a pottential loss to n % of position, while leaving unlimited profit pottential.

# Results
The two .pdf's files are a result of backtesting this bot on real data over the 9 month period.

This is not a save tool to be used with real money, it was made only for science purposes
